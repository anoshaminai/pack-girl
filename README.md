# pack-girl

It's winter break and, after a long semester, I'm finally going home! Except- oh no! My ride to the airport will be here soon and
I haven't packed. To make things worse, my room is a total mess. Help me pack my suitcase before the timer is up and my ride is here. 

TO PLAY:
- Use the arrow keys to help Anosha navigate her room. Pick up clothes items to fill up her suitcase and trash items to fill up her
  trash can. You'll need to fill both before the timer runs out to win!
