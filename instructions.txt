Yay, my last final is done and I'm about to go home for winter break! Except... my ride to the
airport will be here soon and I haven't even thought about packing and my room's a mess. Oh no! 
Help me pack my suitcase before my ride gets here or I'll miss my flight! Don't forget, I also
need to clean my room! I hope I can finish in time!

HOW TO PLAY:
To start the game, press the start button. Use the arrow keys to navigate Anosha around her room. 
To pick up objects, just walk over them. Clothes help fill up the suitcase, while trash items fill
the trash can. Fill both the suitcase and trash can before the time runs out to win!
